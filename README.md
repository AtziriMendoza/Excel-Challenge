# Line Graph Questions
1) Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?

The best time to launch a successful campaign is in the months of June and July with July being the best for outcome of success. Campaigns are less likely to fail in September. The success rate is higher than that of the rate of failure in general. Not a lot of campaigns end up being cancelled. Goals between 1000-4999 (high number of projects fell in this range) had a higher chance of success followed by goals between 15,000-34,999 (low number of projects fell in this range). Theatre tends to be the most common project that is crowd funded with plays being the most popular with a success rate of 53%. 

In conclusion, to have a successful campaign the best time to launch would be in July with a goal of 1000-4999 and since theatre is tried true and tested it would have to be a project in theatre.

2) What are some limitations of this dataset?

This data is not representative of all crowdfunding ventures since it is coming from one source. The sample size is not large, and it may be biased as it seems like the theatre ventures are the most popular in this data set.  A solution to both limitations is to pull data from other crowd funding sources.

Also, the dataset is outdated and only goes up to the year 2020 which was during the pandemic. We would need newer data from the most recent years to get a better landscape of present data.

3) What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?

We could have done a pie chart to determine as a whole of all the projects that were launched were successful, canceled, failed, and live. It could have given a nice overall picture of the projects. Pie charts aren’t really that great but sometimes they give a nice insight into the whole. 

Bar and line charts are typically the best and most descriptive chart options.


# Variability Data Questions
1) Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data.

I think the median gives a more accurate representation of the data as there are a lot of outliers for both successful campaigns and failed campaigns.

3) Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?

There is slightly more variability in successful campaigns than with failed campaigns according to the standard deviation, variance, and range (MAX value – MIN).

It does make more sense to me since it seems like the more likely outcome of a failed campaign is that it may not have had enough backers thus possibly not enough money to launch. Based on the data the failed campaigns had a lower number of backs on average. The outliers in the failed campaigns were ones that had many backers there weren’t a lot of them that had more than 115 backers, which was the median value.
